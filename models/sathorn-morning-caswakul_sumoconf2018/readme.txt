Sathorn dataset version 1 
=========================

/* Released as an example dataset to accompany Chula-SSS codes, which are explained in our SUMO User Conference 2018 paper.)
*/

This directory contains the files necessary to run our Sathorn dataset, Bangkok, Thailand. This version is based on the calibration attempt done by Miss Napatsorn Tantasanee under the academic supervision of Dr Chaodit Aswakul in academic year 2016 at Department of Electrical Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Thailand.

Disclaimer: please treat this dataset as an ongoing work. We are at this moment trying to improve our dataset by

1) recalibrating with a finer grain of parameters
2) adding extra flows to mimic road network deadlocks that we have found in practice in the Sathorn road network.
